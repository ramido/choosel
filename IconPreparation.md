Most of the icons that are used in Choosel are based on the 22x22px icons in [Tango Icon Library](http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Desktop_Project).

Choosel ActionBar icons should be

  * 22x22px
  * saved as PNG
  * available in three versions (highlighted, normal, disabled)
  * the highlighted version uses the original colors (Tango Desktop color palette)
  * the normal version is based on the highlighted version. Use the [Gimp](http://www.gimp.org/) colorize function with hue 214, saturation 30, lighting 47 to create the normal version of the icon.
  * the disabled version is based on the highlighted version. Use the [Gimp](http://www.gimp.org/) colorize function with hue 214, saturation 30, lighting 75 to create the disabled version of the icon.
